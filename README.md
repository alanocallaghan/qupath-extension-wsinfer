# QuPath WSInfer extension

This repo contains the QuPath extension that adds support for the [WSInfer Model Zoo](https://wsinfer.readthedocs.io).

Together, QuPath & WSInfer aim to make deep learning-based patch classification easy and interactive for pathology images.

To find out more, check out our preprint on arXiv:

**If you use this extension, please cite both the [WSInfer preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04631) and the [QuPath paper](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/0.4/docs/intro/citing.html)!**

## Installation

Download the latest version of the extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-wsinfer/releases).

Then drag & drop the downloaded .jar file onto the main QuPath window to install it.

## Usage

The WSInfer extension adds a new menu item to QuPath's **Extensions** menu, which can be used to open a WSInfer dialog.

The dialog tries to guide you through the main steps, from top to bottom.
For a step-by-step guide,see [ReadTheDocs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/deep/wsinfer.html).

And if things don't go to plan or you want to discuss more, please post your questions on the [Scientific Community Image Forum (image.sc)](https://forum.image.sc/tag/wsinfer) - and tag both `wsinfer` and `qupath` so we notice.
